- [patch] 0f3b87a:

## 0.4.3
- [patch] 4b2b662:

  - Reorganise how templates are stored
      This is a bunch of changes that should mostly only be relevant internally.

      First is that there is a `/templates` directory instead of `constants.js` to
      store templates in. This makes it easy to read a template an easy to see how to add a new template

      Secondly, while `codesandboxer-fs` still has its own templates, it inherits templates from `codesandboxer`
      meaning that a template can be added in one and flow down to the other.

      This sets up for Vue sandboxes.
- [patch] 4b2b662:

  - Add Vue template to upload vue sandboxes
      In addition, codesandboxer will do its best to autodetect if it is
      processing a vue, react, or react-typescript sandbox, and use the
      preferred sandbox unless otherwise specified.

Using 0.4 of codesandboxer, leading to better analysis of imports/exports and support for parsing requires

If the entry file is of a different file type, automatically add that file type to the allowed extensions.

Actually fix bug with path resolution.

## 0.2.0

Using v0.3 of codesandboxer - API changes that have made fs work much more nicely

dry flag is now '--dry, -D' instead of '--dry, -d' (this has been made so -d can be used with dependencies)
Added '--name' flag, which allows you to name your sandbox
Fixed a bug with path resolution that would lead to trying to access non-existent files
